Hi! My name is Joshua-Luke Lacsamana, but you can just call me Luke. I am a CS student with an ambition to become a well rounded software engineer! Any projects, whether school or personal related, will be added to my github account for showcase! :)

Currently, my two biggest projects are both private repositories, but I can give you some details on them!
* A fully fledged Inventory Management System for a local company called Marine Custom Solutions in Daytona Beach, Florida
* A group project that involves a machine learing algorithm for matching web scraped clothing on depop

My goal is to master many different technologies in the software engineering space, so that I may take my expertise to a profesional level.
